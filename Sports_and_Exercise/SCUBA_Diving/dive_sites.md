### Gordon's Bay

Location: [https://goo.gl/maps/oA3db7XMdpVi1yQE6](https://goo.gl/maps/oA3db7XMdpVi1yQE6)
Max Depth: 14m

A well-known dive site located near Clovelly Beach. The location marker above identifies the recommended entry point for this dive (view using satellite). The best access point for this site is to park at Clovelly Beach carpark and walk down to the entry point. There is a trail marked underwater that can be followed around the bay. The first marker for the trail starts close to the entry point. From there you can follow the chain until it splits in two directions on marker 3. This is the beginning of the loop, from here you can progress along either route and circle around. An alternative dive is to follow the chain until marker 23, then progress East along the rock faces. This will start to take you out of the bay, so conditions and visibility can deteriorate quickly. Exiting Gordon's Bay is ideally done via the same point used for entry, however if conditions do not allow this to be done safely, an alternative is to exit onto the beach at the end of the bay instead. Particularly during an incoming high-tide, swell at the entry point can make access difficult and care should be taken entering the water to not get washed into the rocks. If exiting in these conditions, it is recommended to begin further East, as the incoming tide will tend to push divers West, especially if there is high swells.

### Camp Cove

* Location: [https://goo.gl/maps/ZgBcuko6Qi2YifyZA](https://goo.gl/maps/ZgBcuko6Qi2YifyZA)
* Max Depth: 14m+ left hand side, 6-8m right hand side

Shallow dive site located near Watson's Bay. From the beach facing the water, the right-hand side offers a dive with a depth of 4-6m along the cliff face, travelling north. As you round the tip towards South Head, swells and surge can become and issue and it is recommended to turn around instead of continuing onwards. The left hand side offers similar depths near the rocks, eventually dropping off to 10m+ as you move further towards the harbour. There is also a bommie running north-south in the middle of the beach. Camp Cove can be a popular fishing area, especially along the left-hand side. Be careful of fishing line and also loose tackle lying in the sand. Boats are prohibited from entering close to the beach, however further out they can pose another hazard to be aware of. Deploy an SMB or dive flag if you are planning to ascend from depth away from the beach. Because of the sheltered location, this site is able to be dived in most weather conditions.

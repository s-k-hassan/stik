# Recreational Diving

## What is it

Recreational diving is generally described as any diving within the recreational limits of ISO specification. Specifically, they include the following aspects:

* Maximum depth of less than 40m
* Dives are completed using air or EANx (Nitrox) with a maximum PPO2 of 1.4 at max maximum depth of the dive and less than 40% O2 by volume
* Dives will use a single gas mixture
* Dives will not include any planned decompression
* Dives will not enter environments with overhead structures where the linear route to the surface is greater than 40m

## Recreational Diving Progressions

There are several certifying bodies for recreational diving globally, however they generally have similar equivalent certification levels:

### Open Water

This is typically the entry-level certification for all dive agencies and certifies a diver for supervised dives at maximum depths of 18m-20m.

### Advanced Diver

This certification will expand the maximum depths for certified divers to 30m-35m.

### Rescue Diver / Assistant Instructor

This certification provides qualification for a diver to begin to assist instructors or divemasters during commercial recreational engagements, however they are not able to lead or instruct themselves.

### Divemaster

A divemaster is considered the first level of commercial recreational diving, where the diver is able to plan and execute a dive plan for a group of divers.

### Instructor

A person certified to an instructor level is able to lead commercial recreational dive and also provide instruction to new divers and certify them.

Additional to these, most dive agencies will include additional specialties for specific aspects of diving and may require some of these additional certifications as part of the expanded training program. These certifications can include different envionmental factors, breathing gases, depth or education on marine life.
